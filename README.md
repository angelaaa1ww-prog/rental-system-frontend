## 🚀 About The Project

**Gifted Hands Ventures PMS** was built to solve a real problem — a landlord managing 5 apartments across Kenya using Excel spreadsheets. Tracking rent payments, tenant details, overdue balances, and sending reminders manually was time-consuming and error-prone.

This system replaces all of that with a **single web application** that the landlord can access from any phone or computer, anywhere in the world.

> Built by **Angela Amani** — at age 18, before joining campus. 🔥
